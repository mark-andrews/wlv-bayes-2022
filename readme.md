# Bayesian Data Analysis

Bayesian methods are now increasingly widely in data analysis across most
scientific research fields.  Given that Bayesian methods differ conceptually
and theoretically from their classical statistical counterparts that are
traditionally taught in statistics courses, many researchers do not have
opportunities to learn the fundamentals of Bayesian methods, which makes using
Bayesian data analysis in practice more challenging.  The aim of this course is
to provide a solid introduction to Bayesian methods, both theoretically and
practically.  We will begin by teaching the fundamental concepts of Bayesian
inference and Bayesian modelling, including how Bayesian methods differ from
their classical statistics counterparts, and show how to do Bayesian data
analysis in practice in R.  We then provide a solid introduction to Bayesian
approaches to these topics using R and the `brms` package. Throughout this
course, we will be using, via the brms package, Stan based Markov Chain Monte
Carlo (MCMC) methods.


## Software

A guide to software requirements for this course is [here](software.md).
However, attendees will also be able to use R/RStudio and Bayesian MCMC tools online using a Binder service like this: [![Binder](https://notebooks.gesis.org/binder/badge_logo.svg)](https://notebooks.gesis.org/binder/v2/gh/mark-andrews/hellobinder-rstan/HEAD?urlpath=rstudio)
